## Work Experience
**Geophysicist, Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries – Trinidad and Tobago (Jan 2019 – Aug 2023)**
-	Performed detailed seismic data analysis and interpretation in offshore environments to assess resource potential. This enabled accurate determination of the likelihood of commercial resource viability, informing strategic exploration and development decisions.
- Developed a framework using QGIS to determine the feasibility of proposed seismic acquisition programs in onshore environments. This allowed for efficient evaluations of proposed work programs, with consideration of nearby surface and population constraints.
- Consolidated and organized over 70 years of seismic data, creating a comprehensive digital repository. This significantly enhanced data accessibility and retrieval efficiency for technical teams, streamlining analytical and interpretation workflows.

**Technical Intern, Touchstone Exploration Trinidad Ltd. (Sep 2017 – April 2018)**
-	Conducted comprehensive evaluations for potential Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects in shallow onshore reservoirs.
-	Utilized IHS Kingdom interpretation software to generate detailed reservoir maps, providing critical insights for strategic planning and identifying key geological controls impacting project feasibility.

**Subsurface Intern, BHP (Summer 2018	)**
- Investigated controls on reservoir distribution and compartmentalisation via detailed seismic interpretation workflows using Schlumberger’s Petrel software.
